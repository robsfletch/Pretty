# To-Do List

## Redo switch for when it works
-   There's an if statement for when I have specific code written for a given function. The if isn't quite right in that it should be able to pick up on scatter, scatte, scatt, scat, etc. for example, but currently does not. I could do this by hand but maybe there's a nicer way.

## hbar

## hist_horizontal
